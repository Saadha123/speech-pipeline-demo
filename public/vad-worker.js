// This is a placeholder for a VAD worker script if you want to use WebAssembly or a worker-based VAD.
// For a simple demo, you can use the browser's Web Audio API to detect volume changes as a proxy for speech.

// For production, use Silero VAD WebAssembly: https://github.com/snakers4/silero-vad/tree/master/web_demo
// Or use a library like https://github.com/voice-engine/silero-vad-js
